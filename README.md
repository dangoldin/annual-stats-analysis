# annual-stats-analysis

I've been collecting various stats for each day over the past year and this is the code to analyze and visualize it.

## To run:
```
python analyze-v2.py stats2016.csv
```

## File format:
- Columns: Date,Bed,Wakeup,MoodMorning,MoodDay,MoodEvening,PhysicalMorning,PhysicalDay,PhysicalEvening,Food,Drinks,Coffee,Tea,Soda

## TODOs:
- Correlations with the moods
- Duplicate text based on frequency
